                <p class="mb-3 text-black dark:text-gray-400">The Carbon Trust may give you the option to subscribe to different services (such as publication ordering and event booking) through this Site. Such services are open to registered users only and your use of the content received through any such service/publication will be subject to these Terms of Use. As part of the registration process, you must therefore agree to accept these Terms of Use. Where registering on behalf of an organisation, you are accepting these Terms of Use on behalf of your organisation. We will let you know if you will also be subject to any additional terms and conditions. We reserve the right to reject or cancel your registration.

            If you use one of the links on this Site to visit a third party website, then condition 9 (Links to third party websites) of these Terms of Use will apply and your viewing of such websites and any purchases or orders made through them will be subject to separate terms and conditions to be entered into between you and the relevant third party.

                <p class="mb-3 text-black dark:text-gray-400">These Terms of Use refer only to your viewing of and using this Site. As mentioned above, separate terms and conditions may apply to promotions which we may run from time to time as well as to products and services sold through this Site. If there is a conflict between the Terms of Use and any specific rules and/or terms and conditions which: (i) appear elsewhere on the Site and are stated to take precedence; or (ii) form part of a separate agreement between the Carbon Trust and you, those other terms will take priority.

            Nothing in the Content within the Site or materials accessed via the Site, other than the Terms of Use, is intended to form any binding contract. In particular, notes on products, services and the like are stated on an 'invitation to treat' basis (i.e. they are not offers which will become binding upon purported acceptance by you) and are 'subject to availability'.

            If the Carbon Trust decides to waive any breach of obligation arising under these Terms of Use, that does not mean that the Carbon Trust has waived any other breach or any future breaches. All rights and remedies under these Terms of Use are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or by any other agreement.

            If at any time any part of the Terms of Use are determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above, then that invalid, illegal or unenforceable part shall be severed from the remainder of the Terms of Use and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remainder of the Terms of Use shall not be affected or impaired in any way. Further, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable part will be deemed superseded by a valid, legal or enforceable part that most closely satisfies the intention of the original part. The validity, legality and enforceability of the remainder of the Terms of Use shall not be affected or impaired in any way. A printed version of this Site and these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.

            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or your use of this Site.

            These Terms of Use are not enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by any person not a party to them.

            These Terms of Use and your use of the Site shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its choice of law provisions. The courts of general jurisdiction located within England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising out of, relating to or concerning these Terms of Use and/or the Site or in which these Terms of Use and/or the Site are a material fact.
